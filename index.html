		<h2> Hero</h2>
		<h4> By: Sterling Knight </h4>
I'm no superman<br>
I can't take your hand<br>
And fly you anywhere<br>
You want to go (yeah)<br>
<br>
I can't read your mind<br>
Like a billboard sign<br>
And tell you everything<br>
You want to hear, but...<br>
<br>
I'll be your hero<br>
<br>
I, I can be everything you need<br>
If you're the one for me<br>
Like gravity<br>
I'll be unstoppable<br>
I, yeah, I believe in destiny<br>
I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul<br>
But if you're the one for me<br>
Then I'll be your hero<br>
<br>
Could you be the one, could you be the one, could you be the one for me?<br>
Then I'll be your hero<br>
Could you be the one, could you be the one, could you be the one for me?<br>
Then I'll be your hero<br>
<br>
Searching high and low<br>
Trying every road<br>
But if I see your face<br>
I'll barely know, yeah<br>
<br>
I'll put my trust in fate<br>
That you will come my way<br>
And if it's right<br>
It's undeniable, yeah<br>
<br>
I'll be your hero<br>
<br>
I, I can be everything you need<br>
If you're the one for me<br>
Like gravity<br>
I'll be unstoppable<br>
I, yeah, I believe in destiny<br>
I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul<br>
But if you're the one for me<br>
Then I'll be your hero<br>
<br>
Could you be the one, could you be the one, could you be the one for me?<br>
I'll be your hero<br>
Could you be the one, could you be the one, could you be the one for me?<br>
Then I'll be your hero<br>
<br>
So incredible<br>
Some kind of miracle<br>
And when it's meant to be<br>
I'll become a hero<br>
So I'll wait, wait, wait, wait for you<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'll be your hero<br>
<br>
I, I can be everything you need, you need<br>
If you're the one for me<br>
Like gravity<br>
I'll be unstoppable, be unstoppable<br>
I, yeah, I believe in destiny<br>
I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul<br>
But if you're the one for me<br>
Then I'll be your hero<br>
<br>
Could you be the one, could you be the one, could you be the one for me?<br>
Then I'll be your hero<br>
Could you be the one, could you be the one, could you be the one for me?<br>
Then I'll be your hero<br>
